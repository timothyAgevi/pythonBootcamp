#Use Python script to generate a random password of 8 characters.
#  Each time the program is run,
#  a new password will be generated randomly. 
# The passwords generated will be 8 characters long
#  and will have to include the following characters in any order:

# 2 uppercase letters from A to Z,
# 2 lowercase letters from a to z,
# 2 digits from 0 to 9,
# 2 punctuation signs such as !, ?, â€œ, # etc.

# Hint: To solve this challenge we will have to generate random characters and to do so we will need to use the ASCII code.
